#Introduction

The script will operate on a set of data from a Samsung phone, taken from this site:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

It will:

1. First set up some general parameters, such as pointing to the directory where the data is stored (It must be in your working directory)

2. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

3. Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

4. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
